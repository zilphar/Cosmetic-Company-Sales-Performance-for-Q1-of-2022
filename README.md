# Cosmetic Company Sales Performance for Q1 of 2022

**<ins>Introduction</ins>**

I conducted an analysis in Excel including data collection, cleaning, exploration, and analysis to create visuals that surface insights on sales trends for the first quarter of 2022 for a Cosmetic Company. The dataset contained data from January 1st 2022 to April 10th 2022. This surfaced insights and recommendations geared towards sales performance, and determining what could be done to attain the set targets for the remaining period of April 2022. The analysis informs the business ensuring that it does not lag behind in sales progress instead creating a path for growth and success. It informs the Company to remain responsive to market demands leading to enhanced sales performance.
